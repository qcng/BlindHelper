# BlindHelper

Blind people are unfortunately unable to visually watch videos. This application provides a tool to help them read videos using their sense of hearing to build an image of what a sense of vision would convey.

# Logic behind this program:

Generating a specialized algorithm called NTSC to decode pixels of every frames of the videos into corresponding sound pitches.

There will be a click sound between every two frames to notify users that a frame has just passed.

A slide handler is established enabling users to skip frames as they wish.

# How to use:

Users need to insert any videos from their computer's main directory (Usually located in C://) and click the play button or simply press enter.

They can control the slide to move backward or forward to a speficic part of the video.

# Frameworks:

Eclipse 4.7

Libray OpenCV 3.3

NetBeans plugins
